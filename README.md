# Quantum Quails

Avian tutors teach the principles of quantum computing operations.

# Project Status

Nothing to see here, just a placeholder at this point.

# Development

Everything needed for the game is contained in the 'public' folder.
All dependencies are loaded via CDN references.  There is no server side code, and
no npm depedencies.  However, [live-server](http://tapiov.net/live-server/) is
recommended for convenient local development; it watches your local files and
automatically reloads the web browser on change.  To get started:

    $ npm install
    $ npm run start
